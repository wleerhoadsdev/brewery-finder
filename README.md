# Brewery Finder

Brewery Finder is a brewery information application that allows users to review and rate beers and brewers to manage brewery and beer information. The front-end is a web client application that communicates with a RESTful API server in the back-end.

This application was created by a team of five developers including myself. We used the Scrum Agile software development methodology. The project was the final capstone project for the April-November 2022 Merit America Java Development Program, a \*30-week intensive program focused on full stack web application development. The program included hands-on coursework in Java development, client-server programming (SQL + Spring), and front-end development (classic Web + React).

        <td> Back-end Development: <ul>
                <li>Architected back-end classes (using UML) and created
                    their .java files with most method implementations
                    stubbed out, thus providing a skeleton that was quickly
                    completed during the coding phase.<br>NOTE: Git history
                    incorrectly indicates some of the .java files were
                    created by Patrick Tucker due to the way a merge request
                    was handled on the Git server that originally hosted the
                    repository.</li>
                <li>Completed BreweryController and dependent classes, thus
                    providing main brewery information functionality and a
                    coding pattern used by myself and Dzmitry to rapidly
                    complete remaining back-end classes.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented authorization for controller
                    endpoint methods.</li>
                <li>Created a set of Postman automated integration tests and
                    used them while testing and debugging code changes for
                    adding authorization support.</li>

## Merit America Staff Contributions

This repository was created by Merit America staff on the Merit America GitLab server hosted by Tech Elevator. The initial commit was performed by technical coach/advisor and product owner William Haywood. It contained two starter projects, a basic "hello world" front-end React project with a basic user login UI and a back-end Spring Boot Java web server project with an authentication controller. The repository was then forked by the team lead of each student project team.

\* As of this writing on 12/18/2022, the <a target="_blank" href="https://meritamerica.org/courses/java-development/">Merit America Java Development Program</a> has been recently shortened from 30 to 21 weeks. I need to verify this, but according to some people I have spoken to the front-end curriculum has been dropped.
